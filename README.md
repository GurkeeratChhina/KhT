## Usage ##

The package _KhT_ computes the Khovanov and Bar-Natan homology of arbitrary tangles from a splitting into elementary tangles. For pointed 4-ended tangles, it also computes the immersed curve invariants from [[KWZ]](https://github.com/spinachstealer/KhT#References). An example can be found in `examples/2-cable-trefoil.py`. Simply open the terminal in the root folder and run

    python3 KhT 2-cable-trefoil

This creates the two files 

* `examples/2-cable-trefoil_BNr_field=7.pdf` and
* `examples/2-cable-trefoil_Khr_field=7.pdf`

which contain the reduced Bar-Natan homology and the reduced Khovanov homology of the tangle, respectively.
To compute a new example, make a copy of the template file

    cp examples/template.py examples/new_tangle.py

and edit the new file appropriately. The computation for the new tangle can be run via

    python3 KhT new_tangle
